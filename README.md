# note_taker

## Description

This application allows you to create, edit and store notes. My motivation for creating this application was to create a simple program that can help me organize my daily tasks.
I wanted to build this project to challenge my knowledge using express.js. 
What I learned from this project was how to implement express.js as well as how to upload an application to Heroku.

## Installation

If you would like to use this application. You can download from my public github page.

##  Usage

Below is a screenshot of the application. The application is very intuitive. Click the "+" icon at the top to create a new note. Add a title to your note and details into the body. Click the save icon and your note will be saved to the left hand side.
